Some found bugs:

if a Pyro Orc is on a ledge above or below the player with the same X coordinate, the Pyro Orc Velocity makes the sprite change direction constantly. 
Dead AI and player models remain throughout all attempts. - sometimes even after restarting the browser entirely: clearing the browser's cache seems to remove them.
Text that appears when looting a chest or killing all Pyro Orc's seems unable.
